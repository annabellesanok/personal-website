    summary: |
      Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a Computer Science and Business student at Northeastern University, graduating in May. 
      Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience as a software engineering Co-op at two asset management firms in Boston, 
      where I worked on developing real-world systems and honing my technical skills. This website showcases some of the projects I’ve worked 
      on during my studies and personal explorations. If you’re curious to dive deeper, feel free to check out my GitHub for more detailed 
      code and repositories. Thanks for visiting!
