    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a Computer Science and Business student at Northeastern University, graduating in May. 
      Over the past few years, I’ve gained hands-on experience as a software engineering Co-op at two asset management firms in Boston, 
      where I worked on developing real-world systems and honing my technical skills. This website showcases some of the projects I’ve worked 
      on during my studies and personal explorations. If you’re curious to dive deeper, feel free to check out my GitHub for more detailed 
      code and repositories. Thanks for visiting!

      - title: Image Collaging Program
        link: "https://github.com/annabellesanok/ImageProcessing"
        tagline: "This project is a versatile image processing tool built using Java and Java Swing, 
        offering both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a text-based interface using commands. It allows users to create, 
        edit, and save collage-style projects by adding multiple image layers, applying one of 12 filters, 
        and arranging images at specified positions. The tool supports PPM, JPEG, and PNG formats, enabling 
        users to save individual layers or entire projects. The application features a modular design using interfaces 
        and the Command Design Pattern, ensuring scalability and flexibility. Below is an example of the UI with a collage
        project started."

      - title: Set Game
        link: "https://github.com/annabellesanok/SetGame"
        tagline: "This project is a command-line implementation of the popular card game Set, with customizable board sizes. 
        Players identify valid sets on the board, which are then replaced with new cards. The game was designed with a strong 
        focus on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. The model holds the card representations and core game 
        logic, including methods to validate sets and retrieve cards based on player input. The view manages the display of the 
        board in the command line, while the controller handles player inputs and game interactions."

      - title: Financial Indicators 
        link: "https://github.com/annabellesanok/DS4200finalProject"
        tagline: "In this project, I collaborated on building a website using HTML and CSS to showcase dynamic financial 
        data visualizations. The website features interactive Altair visualizations created in Python, comparing financial 
        metrics like debt-to-equity ratios, working capital, and profitability trends of S&P 500 companies. We analyzed data 
        for leading healthcare and tech firms to highlight sector-specific financial strategies and investor sentiments. 
        The interactive features, such as dropdown filters, enhance user engagement, making complex data accessible and 
        insightful. The website can be accessed <a href='https://annabellesanok.github.io/DS4200finalProject/' target='_blank'>here</a>."
